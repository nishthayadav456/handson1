    <h2 style="color:red">what is CSS?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be dispalyed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
        <li><span class="lt">Css is not necessary</span><span class="bg">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages allat once</li>
        <li class="con"> External stylesheets are stored in Css files.</li>
    </ol>

      <h2> CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
     
     <ul>
        <div class="con2">
        <li>Inline-by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal-by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External-by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS,is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,in this 
            <span class="bg"> tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> this is easier to demonstrate ,and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
        </div>
    </ul>
           <p class="pre">
           when comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also
           special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Java Script. <br>
           In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to 
           element.<br>
           There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and Id. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
